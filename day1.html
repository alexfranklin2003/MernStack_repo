    <!--Explanation of Web Development Basics-->
    <h3>Web Development Basics:</h3>
    <p>
      Today, I learned the foundational concepts of web development. These
      include understanding how web applications work, the importance of
      protocols, and the role of IP addresses in communication between devices.
      Here's a brief summary:

    <h3>5 Basic Terminologys--</h3>
    <p>
      <strong>1. Protocols:</strong>
      Protocols are rules that govern communication between applications. I
      learned about the **client-server architecture** and how data flows
      between the client (browser) and the server (backend).
    </p>
    <br />
    <strong>2. IP Address:</strong>
    <p>
      IP addresses are unique identifiers for devices on a network. I learned
      about: - **Private IPs** (used within local networks). - **Public IPs**
      (used to access devices over the internet). Example: Swiggy uses public IP
      addresses to serve its website. Challenges: Memorizing IP addresses is
      difficult, which is why we use domain names.
    </p>
    <br />
    <strong>3. Domain Name System (DNS):</strong>
    <p>
      The system that maps domain names (like swiggy.com) to their IP addresses.
    </p>
    <br />
    <strong>4. Domain Registrars:</strong>
    <p>Companies that allow us to register domain names for websites.</p>
    <br />
    <strong>5. URLs:</strong>
    <p>
      Uniform Resource Locators are the complete web addresses we use to access
      resources on the internet.
    </p>

    <!-- Practicing HTML -->
    <h3>My First HTML File</h3>
    <p>
      I practiced creating an HTML file using VS Code. - Commands used: `cd` to
      navigate directories, `mkdir` to create folders. - HTML files are saved
      with the `.html` extension. - Shortcut for HTML5 structure in VS Code:
      `html:5`.
    </p>

    <!-- Heading Tags and Paragraphs -->
    <h3>Heading Tags and Paragraphs:</h3>
    <p>
      I practiced using heading tags (h1 to h6) and paragraph tags ('p') to
      structure content. These tags help create a clear hierarchy for the
      webpage.
    </p>

    <!-- Final Note -->
    <h3>Excited for the Journey Ahead!</h3>
    <p>
      This is just the beginning of my web development journey. Iâ€™m looking
      forward to learning more and building amazing projects!
